const VALID_CONNECTION_DIRECTIVES = [
  "Keep-Alive",  // Specifies a parameter used to control the time a connection may remain open.
  "close",       // Indicates that either the client or the server would like to close the connection.
  "upgrade",     // Used to request a change in the protocol being used on this connection (e.g., upgrading from HTTP 1.1 to WebSocket).
  "compress",    // Suggests that the data should be compressed before transmission (not a standard directive).
  "decompress",  // Suggests that the data should be decompressed on receipt (not a standard directive).
  "proxy-connection",  // Similar to Connection but specifically for proxy dynamic labels (not officially part of HTTP/1.1).
  "HTTP2-Settings",  // Used in HTTP/2 for setting protocol parameters before the actual switch.
  "transfer-encoding",  // Specifies the form of encoding used to safely transfer the payload body to the user.
  "trailer",  // Indicates that the sender will include metadata in the trailer of a message encoded with chunked transfer coding.
  "Keep-Alive-Timeout",  // Specifies the timeout parameter for the Keep-Alive connection directive.
  "Max-Forwards",  // Limits the number of times a message can be forwarded through proxies or gateways.
  "buffering",    // Custom directive to control buffering policies on the server (not a standard directive).
  "no-buffer",    // Custom directive indicating that buffering should not be used (not a standard directive).
  "pre-connect",  // Custom directive to perform connection optimizations before a full HTTP connection is made (hypothetical).
  "post-check",   // Custom directive indicating that the response should be checked after it is sent to ensure integrity.
  "pre-check",    // Custom directive indicating that the response should be checked before it is sent to ensure integrity.
  "no-store",     // Directive that can be used to indicate that no parts of the request or response should be cached.
  "reload",       // Custom directive to force all caches to submit the request to the origin server for validation.
  "no-transform", // Directive indicating that an intermediate cache or proxy should not modify the media type or content.
  "only-if-cached",  // Custom directive that requires a cache to send a response only if it is already stored in the cache.
  "retry-after",  // Specifies how long the client should wait before making a follow-up request.
  "session-keep", // Hypothetical directive to maintain session-specific data over the connection.
  "immutable",    // Informs that the response body will not change over time.
  "observe",      // Custom directive used in monitoring or debugging to observe connection behaviors.
  "timeout-hint"  // Suggests to clients the expected timeout for requests to help manage connection closures more gracefully.
